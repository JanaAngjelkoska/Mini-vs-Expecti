# Mini vs Expecti
## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to build data structures, and evaluation functions to be utilized by adversarial searching
algorithms and compare how they fare against each other at different depths, with different possible custom evaluation functions.
## Project Structure
Please note that the python files are well documented, and there is no documentation here.
- `utility`: Utility classes and data structures that can be used for exploring how the search space of a chess environment feels like. (Note: not used in the implementation of the algorithms)
- `search`: Algorithms that play chess.
- `eval`: Definition of the evaluation function and arbitrary heuristics.
